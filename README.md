# hello-world
Does DEVS hate Implementers?

# About me
I'm Gabriel from Argentina, and I'm implementer. And I think implementation is far too underrated. Who, having some tecnical skills, would like to deal with confused clients? That's what Implementers do.

# Are you programmer?
I would't say so. I have learned programming (as algorithm creation) and some code of BASIC, FoxPro, ANSI C, obviously Visual Basic and Visual FoxPro, and some Java. Recently I've done a few working things in PHP, that includes to create many HTML and CSS tags (are they programming?). But I have measured my skills in this way: If you put me on developing, I will get things done like 20-30% later than a Dev. So, you better set me where I can serve the best, that is as Implementer.
